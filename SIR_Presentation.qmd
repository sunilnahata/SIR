# Rules of the game

Player then chooses: - **No switch** - **Switch** - **Random choice**

Goal: maximize expected winnings

# Why this is interesting

-   Intuition: "Two boxes left → 50/50"\
-   Reality: conditional probability changes the situation\
-   We'll test by simulation (1000 runs per strategy)

# Simulation 

We simulate three functions (*no switch*, *switch*, *random*). Each game:

1.  Create boxes `c(1e6, 0.10, 0.10)` placed randomly
2.  Player makes an initial uniform random pick
3.  Host opens a dime box among the remaining
4.  Player applies a strategy to pick final box
5.  Repeat N times and compute mean winnings

# No Switch

```{r}

# Player chooses a box and sticks with his choice

game_no_box_change = function(){  
  box = c(1, 1, 1000000)  
  random_choice = sample(1:3, size= 1) 
  chosen_box = box[random_choice] 
  remaining_boxes = box[-random_choice] 
  return(chosen_box)  
}

```

# Always switch

```{r}

# Of the two remaining boxes, the presenter opens a box containing a dime 

game_box_exchange = function(){
  box = c(1, 1, 1000000)
  random_choice = sample(1:3, size= 1)
  remaining_boxes = box[-random_choice]
  if (length(which(remaining_boxes == 1)) == 1){
    chosen_box = remaining_boxes[-which(remaining_boxes == 1)]
  }
  else {
    chosen_box = remaining_boxes[-which(remaining_boxes == 1)[sample(1:2,1)]]
  }
  return(chosen_box)
}

```

# Random choice

```{r}
# Player chooses to keep the box chosen at the beginning or switch to the remaining box, a random choice

game_random_remain_pick = function(){   
  random_choice = sample(1:2, size= 1)    
  if (random_choice == 1) {game_box_exchange()}
  else {game_no_box_change()}
}
```



# 1000 simulations per strategy

```{r}

# Repeat 1000 games

N <- 1000

mean_game_no_box_change <- mean(replicate(N, game_no_box_change()))
mean_game_random_remain_pick <- mean(replicate(N, game_random_remain_pick()))
mean_game_box_exchange <- mean(replicate(N, game_box_exchange()))

              "Random" = mean_game_random_remain_pick,

# Interpretation

-   **No switch** ≈ 33%

-   **Random** ≈ 50%

-   **Switch** ≈ 66% ← Best strategy

-   **Switching boxes** increases the win probability by two times than 
**sticking** with the first choice.

# Why switching wins?


-   Initial pick has probability 1/3 of being the million

-   The two other boxes together have 2/3

-   Host removes one losing box among the two others

-   The remaining closed box therefore carries the full 2/3 probability
